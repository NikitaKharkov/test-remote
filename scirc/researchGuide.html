The fact that Connie’s interaction with Friend occurs on a Sunday could be meant to explore how a lack of religious practice affects the family: “none of them bothered with church.” Although all the other members of Connie’s family go to a picnic, an activity that could reasonably replace the communal and social aspects of a church attendance, Connie does not attend either Church or the family picnic. When Connie first sees Friend’s car and interprets him as a harmless suitor, her first response is to say “Christ, Christ” appealing (if obliquely) to religion to help her look better. One critic comments that the story itself is “about the spiritual condition of late twentieth century American Culture, which Oates believes has become a wasteland” (Slimp). Slimp argues that Connie experiences a “growth of her spiritual nature” during the course of the story. Another critic, Marie Mitchell Olesen Urbanski, suggests that the story is in fact “the framework of a religious allegory—the seduction of Eve.” Many interpretations are possible. </em></span>

Because the family does not attend any church service, they may lack spiritual foundation that would lead to Connie being vulnerable to Friend’s influence. The family’s choice to go a barbeque instead of church shows they are replacing church activities with family activities, but Connie chooses and is allowed to stay home. Ironically, Connie calls on Christ when the men arrive, she uses the term not to ask for spiritual guidance but rather as almost a curse word in her frustration to ‘look better’ for them (Willard). One critical evaluation by Slimp is that the story is “the spiritual condition of late twentieth century American Culture” (qtd. in Willard). Marie Mitchell Olsen Urbanski says the story “is the framework of a religious allegory—the seduction of Eve” (qtd. in Willard) There are several ways to understand the absence of religion in this story (Willard).</span>

								    <p class="medium-normal">Most writers will resist taking actual physical notes on their subject since it can be time consuming.  However, this is one of the most successful ways to keep your information organized and avoid a paper that gives information by <em>source</em> rather than by <em>topic</em>.    
                                            </p>
								    <p class="medium-normal">An alternative option is to simply highlight important information on printed copies of sources and then try to assemble this in some coherent way as you are drafting the paper. </p>
								    <p><span class="medium-normal">Another method often used is to do the entire process electronically.  In this method, you read the online text, never print it out and simply cut and paste what you think is important into another Word document.  However, this approach is not recommended because it will almost always lead to some form of <a href="#plagiarism">plagiarism</a><Plagiarism in Research Glossary>.  Simply cutting and pasting your information into a paper will look like (and be) <a href="#plagiarism">plagiarism</a> <Plagiarism in Research Glossary> at worst and sketchy at best.</span>    </p>								    
								    <p><span class="medium-normal">A common mistake in taking notes and citing is failing to differentiate between an <em>editor</em> and an <em>author</em>.  An edited volume will list the editor as what looks like the author.  If you aren’t paying close attention and miss the “ed.” either before or after the name, you will cite the source as being <em>written</em> by them.  An editor has an essential job in creating the text, often writing an introduction, compiling essays from various writers and perhaps contributing a chapter.  But, in such volumes, each chapter of the book is probably written by a separate author or authors.  These names should appear in the table of contents AND at the start of the chapter.  When citing these sources, <a href="#" onclick="open('citationHelp.html#MLA','citationHelp','top=10,left=200,width=750,height=450,status=1,menubar=1,scrollbars=1,titlebar=0,resizable=1,location=0,toolbar=0');">MLA style</a>, for example, requires that you identify <em>the chapter author</em> for parenthetical citations and the editor in your Works Cited.  A similar mistake is failing to give credit to an authored entry in an encyclopedia or dictionary, noting only the publisher or editor instead.

If you have only three piles with 15 cards per pile, see if you can subdivide some piles into two.  Focus on having the same number of cards per pile to help add balance to your paper.

								   <p><strong><SPAN class=medium-bold id=lblResourcesTitle3><a name="210"></a>Some General Tips When Writing Your Research Paper </SPAN></strong>
								    <p class="medium-normal">FOCUS on your goal.  It is important to remember exactly what a research paper <em>is</em> and <em>does</em>.  First and foremost it is yours.   A teacher should be able to assign the <em>exact same topic</em> for every student and still get completely different papers.  How is this possible?  The paper you write is <em>unique</em> to you. It is influenced and shaped by your personal interests and focus, style and experiences, and connection with your topic.  </p>
								    <p class="medium-normal">EXPECT to have some difficulty obtaining sources and plan your work accordingly.  Gather source material early.    
                                            </p>
								    <p class="medium-normal">PLAN for computer malfunction, just in case. Save a copy of your draft on someone else’s computer, or on a network drive, burn a disk or email a copy of the paper to yourself.</p>
								    <p><span class="medium-normal">PLAN for printer malfunction: print paper out at least a day early to avoid last minute glitches like:  running out of ink, paper jams, printer breakdowns, network problems and possible long lines at school computer printing stations.</span>    </p>								    
								    <p><span class="medium-normal">BE CAREFUL about “recycling” your paper and having it do “double duty.”  Your teacher or professor probably will not be keen on the idea of you using a paper previously written. If you plan on writing the same paper for two or more classes, the general rule of thumb is that you receive approval for doing so well in advance of your writing the paper.</span></p>

Given the number of books, <a href="#newspaper">newspapers</a>, <a href="#magazine">magazines</a>, and online sources available, sometimes it is hard to narrow down information to find the things that are most relevant and most reliable to your topic.  This section is designed to help you evaluate different kinds of information sources, and use the tools available in this database and at your local library to find the ones that are best for whatever project you are working on.</p>
								      
								 <p class="medium-bold"><a name="41"></a>Information in Print and Online:</p>

							     <span class="medium-normal">There are many different printed sources of information.

There are also </SPAN><span class="link-medium">academic</SPAN><span class="medium-normal"> or </SPAN><span class="link-medium">scholarly journals</SPAN><span class="medium-normal">, </SPAN><span class="link-medium"><a href="#newsletter">newsletters</a></SPAN><span class="medium-normal">, </SPAN><span class="link-medium"><a href="#conferenceproceedings">conference proceedings</a></SPAN><span class="medium-normal">, </SPAN><span class="link-medium">dissertations</SPAN><span class="medium-normal">, </SPAN><span class="link-medium">government publications and transcripts</SPAN><span class="medium-normal">.  In addition to being in print, many of these sources are also available electronically through databases like this one and via the World Wide Web.</SPAN>
							     <blockquote><span class="medium-normal"><strong>Example</strong>: <u>William Shakespeare</u>, edited by Harold Bloom is part of a series of reference books called <em>Bloom’s Bio-Critiques</em> available in print at many libraries and online in </span><span class="link-medium">Literary Reference Center.</span></blockquote>

While some online sources are free, others require that either you or your library have a subscription in order to access information. </SPAN>

									 <p class="medium-bold"><a name="42"></a>How Do I Know What to Use?</p>
								<span class="medium-normal">The sources you use depend on what your assignment requires, what is available, and what sources you prefer to use.  If you are not sure exactly what a required information source is, you can ask your teacher or a librarian.</span>
                                <p class="medium-bold"><a></a>Authority and Currency</p>
								<span class="medium-normal">No matter what the informational format, there are some things you should keep in mind when evaluating your source.  The first is <em>authority</em>, and the second is <em>currency</em>. </span>
								   <blockquote><span class="medium-normal"><strong>Authority</strong>: This issue will usually apply only to free web/online sources, not to academic databases like this one.  Most academic books and journals like the ones included on this database are published by universities and scholarly societies. The content is reviewed by a panel of experts on the subject.  Others are published by commercial publishing companies, but are edited by professors or established researchers.  An example of this would be the books in this database that have been edited by <em>Harold Bloom</em>, a professor at <a href="http://www.yale.edu">Yale University</a> <http://www.yale.edu/>and a respected literary critic.  On the World Wide Web, however, knowing if the publisher, author, editor or webmaster is considered an expert with credentials that relate to the topic is an important fact to uncover.  Have other scholars or experts reviewed the work before it was published?  Since anyone can publish things on the web, you will often get search results that are essentially just the opinion of one person with no real background in the subject matter, and are often factually inaccurate. </span></blockquote>
								    <blockquote><span class="medium-normal"><strong>Currency</strong>: When researching science topics, having access to the <em>newest</em> articles published does not necessarily mean having the <em>best</em> articles, but this will vary depending on your subject. For example, if you are writing about Ancient Rome, you may find that some of the most useful material was written several years ago. </span></blockquote>
								    <span class="medium-bold"><a name="43" id="43"></a>Searching Tips for the World Wide Web</span><BR>
								    <BR>
								<span class="medium-normal">It is important to keep the following in mind the following when searching on the World Wide Web:</span>
								 <UL>
								   <span class="medium-normal"><strong>URLs ending in</strong> “<strong>.edu</strong>” are published by educational institutions.  Websites maintained by universities often contain useful academic caliber information placed there by professors, students, departments, or groups.  Be careful not to confuse student-authored essays with essays written by professors.    </SPAN></UL>
								 <UL>
								   <span class="medium-normal"><strong>URLs ending in</strong> “<strong>.org</strong>” are <em>usually</em> published by non-profit organizations.  Many scholarly societies are not-for-profit, and members will often publish papers or presentations on the website.  These sites can also be a good source of bibliographies or book reviews on a particular subject.  Beware: some “.orgs” are masks for businesses or individuals attempting to get you to commercial sites to sell you something.</SPAN>
								  <blockquote><span class="medium-normal"><strong>Example</strong>: <a href="http://www.ala.org/">http://www.ala.org/</a> is the site of the American Library Association. It contains information about reading, literacy, and other library related information. You can find things like lists of literary award winners in the “Libraries & You” section.</span></blockquote>
								  </UL>
								   <UL>
								   <span class="medium-normal">	<strong>URLs ending in</strong> “<strong>.com</strong>” are the sites of </SPAN><span class="link-medium">commercial</SPAN><span class="medium-normal"> or private entities.  These can range from a newspaper site (like that of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>) that contain useful book reviews and author interviews, to online booksellers, where some of the reviews are written by readers and site users who may not have professional knowledge of the subject matter.  Again, it is important to evaluate the purpose of the site, and the credentials of the author. </SPAN>
								   <blockquote class="medium-normal"><strong>Example</strong>: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/books/">http://www.nytimes.com/pages/books/</a> is the <em>The New York Times</em> Book Review section, containing book reviews, author interviews, essays, and articles related to literature.</blockquote>

								   <BR>
								<span class="medium-normal">An important component of internet research is identifying “spam.” The web is a great marketplace, but unfortunately there are some people and businesses that engage in annoying, and sometimes questionable or unethical practices on the web.  There are many ways in which webmasters try to get people to their websites.  Learning to recognize just a few of these will allow you to eliminate irrelevant sites.</span>
								 <UL>
								   <span class="medium-normal"> <strong><em> “Thin affiliates” or “Pay-per-click”</em></strong> sites are pages that serve no purpose other than to get people to another site. Often this is a site where browsers can buy something, generating a commission for the webmaster of the original page. Others sites are fake search result lists which direct you to other sites. Webmasters who create the search page are paid just for generating traffic. Not all affiliate pages are considered “thin;” some may provide value by including product reviews or price comparisons. Those who provide nothing useful on their own are considered “thin.”</SPAN>
								 </UL>
								 <UL>
								
								  <blockquote>
								    <p class="medium-normal"><strong>Example</strong>:
  
                                    </a> Many websites provide pictures and brief descriptions and a “More Information” button. Clicking for more information takes you through commission tracking sites.  For example: <a href="http://www.zappos.com/">http://www.zappos.com</a> takes you to an online retailer with an affiliate program. </p>
								    <p class="medium-normal"><strong>Example</strong>: 


                                      <a href="http://www.toxiclemon.co.uk/Guides_and_Directories/">http://www.toxiclemon.co.uk/Guides_and_Directories/</a> provides what looks like a search engine result list or index, but the results redirect you to different websites. </p>

								   <UL>
								   <span class="medium-normal">                                   <strong><em> Hidden text or keyword loading</em></strong>: 


Webmasters may try to drive traffic to their sites by stuffing keywords and phrases into the page. They do this by hiding the text in a variety of ways: using a 1-point font, using print the same color as the page, or leaving a blank space at the bottom and underneath creating a random list words and phrases. If you see large areas of blank space or random strings of text, this is what is going on. Some of these pages are on legitimate sites, so if you can’t tell for sure check with a librarian, or don’t use it.</SPAN>
								   <blockquote><span class="medium-normal"><strong>Example</strong>: 


                                    Such sites would usually have a box of phrases at the bottom or terms highlighted in yellow or inputting extra text in the same color as the background color of the page or deliberate misspellings, and so on. All such egregious yet somewhat unobvious mistakes link to the same set of pages on the site there to make sure that any one of a number of search terms will bring you to this page.</span></blockquote>
								     </UL>
								   <UL>
								   <span class="medium-normal"> <strong><em> Sneaky redirects</em></strong>: While websites may redirect you for a number of legitimate reasons, such as a change in ISP, other redirects can be useless and annoying. You can tell you are being redirected by watching your browser window: click on a URL and you will see it briefly in your browser, then it will change one or more times until a web page with a completely different address loads. Other redirects seem more straightforward, but end up sending you to a site that spoofs a legitimate source.</SPAN>
								   <blockquote><span class="medium-normal"><strong>Example</strong>:

								 <p class="medium-bold"><a name="45" id="45"></a>Frequently Asked Questions Relating to Information Sources</p>
								   <blockquote><p><strong> <span class="medium-bold">What is a database? </span></strong><BR>
								   <span class="medium-normal"> A <em>database</em> is a collection of information organized around a particular topic. For example, the topic of this database is Science. </span></p>
                                <p><strong> <span class="medium-bold">What kind of information can be found in the <em>Science Reference Center</em>? </span></strong><BR>
								   <span class="medium-normal"> This database contains many different kinds of information relating to Science.  It contains articles from scholarly journals, reference books, encyclopedias, biographies, essays, primary source documents, images, videos and more.  This is a <em>full text</em> database, which means that the complete article, chapter, essay, or summary is available to you to read without having to go to another database or to search the library shelves. </span></p>
								   <p><strong> <span class="medium-bold">Can’t I just find all this same stuff on the Internet? </span></strong><BR>
								   <span class="medium-normal"> No. Only a small percentage of what is available in print is available online. Also, searching the Web may bring back many results, but most of them won’t be relevant.  A database like <em>Science Reference Center</em> <Database Persistent Link> narrows down your search by limiting the subject matter, and organizing the information around specific topics within that subject. </span></p>
								   <p><strong> <span class="medium-bold">What’s a keyword? </span></strong><BR>
								   <span class="medium-normal">A <em>keyword</em> is a word that is used as a starting point for finding information on a particular topic.  When you are searching a database, you choose keywords to find information related to your topic, so you should choose words that represent important ideas related to the subject.  If you use broad terms you will get a lot of results; if use narrow terms, you will get fewer results.  You can use one word (science) or a phrase (Atomic structure) or a combination (Atomic structure and nucleus).</span></p>
								   <p><strong> <span class="medium-bold">What is the difference between a journal and a magazine? </span></strong><BR>
								   <span class="medium-normal"> A <a href="#magazine">magazine</a> <Magazine in Research Glossary> usually has lots of pictures and advertisements, stories of general interest, and comes out weekly or monthly.  A <a href="#journal">journal</a> <Journal in Research Glossary> contains articles about a particular subject, generally does not contain many advertisements, is published less frequently, and is often published by a scholarly society or a university. </span></p>
								   <p><strong> <span class="medium-bold">What does “peer-reviewed” mean? </span></strong><BR>
								   <span class="medium-normal"> When an article is “<a href="#peer">peer-reviewed</a>,” <Peer-reviewed in Research Glossary> it means that it was read and evaluated by people considered experts on the topic.  Often, the people doing the evaluating are college professors who research and teach the subject discussed in the article.  Since the authors are often college professors too, the term “peer” is used.  Sometimes the word “refereed” is used to mean the same thing.</span></p>
								   <p><strong> <span class="medium-bold">What is Boolean searching? Is it the same as an advanced search? Do I have to fill in every single box on that screen to make it work?</span></strong><BR>
								   <span class="medium-normal"> Boolean searching means that you are combining your search terms using the words “not” “and” and “or.”  Advance searches usually incorporate Boolean search techniques.  This type of searching is very helpful when you want a shorter, more specific list or sources.  For example, if you are researching kings of the middle ages, you can search for “kings” AND “Middle Ages.” If you want only English kings, add “AND England.” You don’t have to fill in every box, just use the ones you need.  If you aren’t sure you are combining your search terms correctly, check the “help” section, or ask a librarian.</span></p>
								   <p><strong> <span class="medium-bold">What is a phrase search? </span></strong><BR>
								   <span class="medium-normal"> A phrase search means you are using more than one word to search, but not necessarily using a Boolean search. “Rome” is a keyword, “Ancient Rome” is a phrase.</span></p>

Those who do not read often ‘for fun’ will have a hard time figuring out ‘what is important’ in a reading.  Students who read for fun will have difficulty accepting the idea of ‘picking a text apart’ or what they perceive as ‘looking for stuff that isn’t really there’ or ‘overanalyzing.'</p>

								          <LI> <span class="medium-normal">Over time, you be able to read in a manner which enables you to enjoy what you read while <em>critically</em> assessing it at the same time.  Analytic and critical reading skills carry over into all aspects of your life, from analyzing letters, movies, speeches and television shows, to commercials, advertisements and politics etc.  You will find a hidden world of meaning behind most texts (verbal or written) that you encounter on a daily basis.  The ability to look for clues and analyze intent behind a text will help you communicate and understand motivations of writers and speakers all around you.   </SPAN>

							      <LI><span class="medium-normal">What is Analysis? <em>Analysis</em> explains <em>how</em> a text accomplishes its goals.  If you are reading a piece of literature you should try to first understand the main goal of the writer.  What is the main point of the writing?  In non-fiction this is called a thesis or argument.  If you simply explain what the argument or thesis is in a work you will not be analyzing it, you will be providing a synopsis.  <em>Critical analysis looks first at the point or aim of the text and then explores how the author accomplished this goal</em>.  </SPAN>

								   <LI><span class="medium-normal">Can you go ‘too far’ in analyzing?  Most assuredly, you may go ‘too far.’ One rule of thumb for deciding whether or not you have extended your analysis into realms best left alone is to ask yourself, “is there the proper evidence in this text to support my findings?”</SPAN>

								  <p><strong><SPAN class=medium-bold id=lblResourcesTitle3><a name="52"></a>The Physical Aspect of Interactive Reading</SPAN></strong>
								    <p class="medium-normal">Some feel it is akin to blasphemy to ‘write in a book’, others simply feel it is not essential to make notes in a book in order to fully understand and organize thoughts and information on a text.  A university English professor once started class by asking all his students to open up the novel that was assigned for that day.  He then walked around the room looking at every book.  Returning to his desk, he stated,” Anyone whose book is not marked in anyway did not complete the reading assignment.”  His point was that in order to really interact with a piece of academic literature, a reader should be underlining important things, making connections and writing notes and questions in the margins.  This practice helps in facilitating classroom participation as well as making it easier to write an essay when you have already focused on essential passages and points. </p>
								    <p class="medium-normal"> This practice also helps you to develop an active reading stance rather than a passive reading stance. Passive reading is best saved for popular fiction and magazines you read for fun, not for class. Active reading encourages you to ‘talk back’ to a text, questioning and noting as you read. </p>
								    <p><strong><SPAN class=medium-bold id=lblResourcesTitle3><a name="53"></a>What and How Much?</SPAN></strong>
								    <p class="medium-normal">The whole process of ‘marking up’ a text is rendered useless when you highlight 80% of the text on any one page.  You need to learn how to discriminate between kinds of information is truly worthy of commentary and focus, and what is not. You can start by highlighting or underlining names of characters, dates, and major points.  It is also good practice to underline vocabulary words you do not understand so you can quickly look them up later.</p>
