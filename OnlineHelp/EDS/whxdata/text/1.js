As part of the comprehensive coverage offered by this database, indexing and abstracts for the most important scholarly business journals back as far as 1886 are included. In addition to the searchable cited references provided for more than 1,200 journals, ","Business Source Complete"," contains detailed author profiles for the 25,000 most-cited authors in the database. Journal ranking studies reveal that ","Business Source Complete"," is the overwhelmingly superior database for full text journals in all disciplines of business, including marketing, management, MIS, POM, accounting, finance and economics. Additional full text, non-journal content includes financial data, books, monographs, major reference works, book digests, conference proceedings, case studies, investment research reports, industry reports, market research reports, country reports, company profiles, SWOT analyses and more.","\n          ","[back to top]","\n          ","\n          ","\n          ","There are a number of helpful tips and hints you can use to improve your search results. For example, you can use Boolean operators to link search terms together; and/or limit the search to a specific title.","\n          ","\n          ","\n          ","Sometimes a search can be overly general (results equal too many hits) or overly specific (results equal too few hits). To fine tune your search, you can use AND, OR, and NOT operators to link your search words together. These operators will help you narrow or broaden your search to better express the terms you are looking for and to retrieve the exact information you need quickly.","\n          ","USING THE \"AND\" OPERATOR: If you have a search term that is too general, you can append several terms together using \"AND\". By stringing key terms together, you can further define your search and reduce the number of results. Note: Unless you define a specific search field, the result list will contain references where all your search terms are located in either the citation, full display or full text.","\n          ","• For example, type ","sleep AND walking"," to find results that refer to both sleep and walking.","\n          ","USING THE \"OR\" OPERATOR: In order to broaden a search, you can link terms together by using the \"OR\" operator. By using \"OR\" to link your terms together you can find documents on many topics. Linked by this operator, your words are searched simultaneously and independently of each other.","\n          ","• As an example, search ","sleep AND walking OR waking"," to find results that reference the terms \"sleep\" and \"walking\", or the term \"waking\".","\n          ","USING THE \"NOT\" OPERATOR: In order to narrow a search, you can link words together by using the \"NOT\" operator. This operator will help you to filter out specific topics you do not wish included as part of your search.","\n          ","\n            ","Type: ","sleep OR walking NOT waking"," to find results that contain the terms \"sleep\" or \"walking\" but not the term \"waking\".","\n            ","To further define your results, type: ","sleep AND walking AND waking"," to constrict the search to include all terms linked by the \"AND\" operator.","\n          ","\n          ","\n          ","\n          ","Parentheses also may be used to control a search query. Without parentheses, a search is executed from left to right. Words that you enclose in parentheses are searched first. Why is this important? Parentheses allow you to control and define the way the search will be executed. The left phrase in parentheses is searched first; then based upon those results the second phrase in parentheses is searched.","\n          ","\n            ","Generalized Search: ","dog or cat and show or parade","\n            ","Focused Search: ","(dog or cat) and (show or parade)","\n          ","\n          ","In the first example, the search will retrieve everything on dog or cat shows AS WELL AS everything on parades whether or not the articles refer to dogs or cats.","\n          ","In the second example, we have used the parentheses to control our query to only find articles about shows or parades that reference dogs or cats.","\n          ","[back to top]","\n          ","\n          ","\n          ","The default fields for unqualified searches consist of the following: all authors, all subjects, all keywords, all title info (including source title) and all abstracts.","\n          ","The following list will help you locate detailed information referenced in this database as a field.","\n          ","\n            ","\n              ","\n                ","Searchable tag","\n                ","Description","\n                ","Example","\n              ","\n              ","\n                ","AB","\n                ","Abstract or Author Supplied Abstract","\n                  [Word Indexed]\n                  ","Performs a keyword search of the abstract summaries.","\n                ","\n                ","AB Tax Cut","\n              ","\n              ","\n                ","AD","\n                ","Author Affiliation","\n                  [Phrase Indexed]\n                  ","Performs an exact search for companies or organizations an author is affiliated with, may also include correspondence address.
