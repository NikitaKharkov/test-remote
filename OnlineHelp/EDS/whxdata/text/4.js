In addition to the full text, this database offers indexing and abstracts for more than 8,500 journals. This scholarly collection offers information in nearly every area of academic study including: computer sciences, engineering, physics, chemistry, language and linguistics, arts & literature, medical sciences, ethnic studies, and many more. ","Academic Search Premier"," is an enormous collection of the most valuable peer-reviewed full text journals, offering critical information from many sources unique to this database. Examples of titles offered in ","Academic Search Premier"," include: ","American Historical Review, American Journal of Political Science, American Libraries, American Sociologist, British Journal of Psychology, British Journal of Sociology, Central European History, Contemporary Literature, Early American Literature, English Language Notes, Family Relations, International Journal of Psychology, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Journal of Aesthetics & Art Criticism, Journal of Counseling & Development, Journal of Education, Political Science Quarterly, Journal of General Psychology, Journal of Genetic Psychology, Journal of International Affairs, Journal of Learning Disabilities, Journal of Marriage & Family, Journal of Politics, Journal of Psychology, Journal of Social Psychology, Library Journal, Social Forces, Sociological Review, Theological Studies, Women's Studies,"," etc. PDF backfiles to 1975 or further are available for well over one hundred journals, and searchable cited references are provided for more than 1,000 titles. The majority of full text titles are available in native (searchable) PDF, or scanned-in-color.","\n          ","[","back to top","]","\n          ","\n          ","\n          ","There are a number of helpful tips and hints you can use to improve your search results. For example, you can use Boolean operators to link terms together; limit the search to a specific title; and /or restrict the search to a particular date range.","\n          ","Note: Stopwords are commonly used words such as articles, pronouns, and prepositions. These words are not indexed for searching in the database. For example, 'the', 'for', and 'of' are stopwords. When a stopword is used in a query, any single word or no word is retrieved in place of the stopword. When searching strings that contain stopwords or a Boolean operator, it is necessary to use quotation marks.","\n          ","\n          ","Sometimes a search can be overly general (results equal too many hits) or overly specific (results equal too few hits). To fine tune your search, you can use AND, OR, and NOT operators to link your search words together. These operators will help you narrow or broaden your search to better express the terms you are looking for and to retrieve the exact information you need quickly.","\n          ","USING THE \"AND\" OPERATOR: If you have a search term that is too general, you can append several terms together using \"AND\". By stringing key terms together, you can further define your search and reduce the number of results. Note: Unless you define a specific search field, the result list will contain references where all your search terms are located in either the citation, full display or full text.","\n          ","\n            ","For example, type ","high risk AND injury"," to find results that refer to both high risk and injury.","\n          ","\n          ","USING THE \"OR\" OPERATOR: In order to broaden a search, you can link terms together by using the \"OR\" operator. By using \"OR\" to link your terms together you can find documents on many topics. Linked by this operator, your words are searched simultaneously and independently of each other.","\n          ","\n            ","As an example, search ","high risk AND injury OR trauma"," to find results that contain either the terms \"high risk\" and \"injury\", or the term \"trauma\".","\n          ","\n          ","USING THE \"NOT\" OPERATOR: In order to narrow a search, you can link words together by using the \"NOT\" operator. This operator will help you to filter out specific topics you do not wish included as part of your search.","\n          ","\n            ","Type: ","high risk OR injury NOT trauma"," to find results that contain the terms \"high risk\" or \"injury\", but not the term \"trauma\".","\n            ","To further define your results, type: ","high risk AND injury AND trauma"," to constrict the search to include all terms linked by the \"AND\" operator.","\n          ","\n          ","\n          ","\n          ","Parentheses also may be used to control a search query. Without parentheses, a search is executed from left to right. Words that you enclose in parentheses are searched first. Why is this important? Parentheses allow you to control and define the way the search will be executed. The left phrase in parentheses is searched first; then based upon those results the second phrase in parentheses is searched.","\n          ","Generalized Search:","\n          ","\n            ","early education OR pre-school AND adult education OR secondary schools","\n              ","\n              ","Focused Search:","\n              (early education OR pre-school) AND (adult education OR secondary schools)","\n          ","\n          ","In the first example, the search will retrieve everything on \"early education\" as well as references to the terms \"pre-school\" and \"adult education\", and everything on \"secondary schools\".","\n          ","In the second example, we have used the parentheses to control our query to only find articles about \"early education or pre-school\" that reference \"adult education or secondary schools\".","\n          ","[","back to top","]","\n          ","\n          ","\n          ","The default fields for unqualified searches consist of the following: all authors, all subjects, all keywords, all title info (including source title) and all abstracts.","\n          ","The following list will help you locate detailed information referenced in this database as a field.","\n          ","\n            ","\n              ","\n                ","Searchable Tag","\n                ","Description","\n                ","Example","\n              ","\n              ","\n                ","AB","\n                ","Abstract","\n                  [Word Indexed]\n                  ","Performs a keyword search of the abstract summaries.","\n                ","\n                ","AB civil liberties","\n              ","\n              ","\n                ","AD","\n                ","\n                  ","Author Affiliation","\n                    [Phrase Indexed]","\n                  ","Performs an exact search for companies or organizations an author is affiliated with, may also include correspondence address.","\n                ","\n                ","AD \"School of the Environment and Natural Resources, Bangor University, Gwynedd LL57 2UW, UK\"","\n              ","\n              ","\n                ","AF","\n                ","\n                  ","Author Affiliation","\n                    [Word Indexed]","\n                  ","Performs a keyword search for companies or organizations an author is affiliated with, may also include correspondence address.","\n                ","\n                ","AF Iowa State University","\n              ","\n              ","\n                ","AN","\n                ","Accession Number","\n                  [Phrase Indexed]\n                  ","Performs an exact search for an article's unique identificaton number.","\n                ","\n                ","AN 11509699","\n              ","\n              ","\n                ","AR","\n                ","Author Phrase","\n                  [Phrase Indexed]\n                  ","Performs an exact search for an article's author, in the format of last name, first name, and middle initial if available.","\n                ","\n                ","AR Rompalske, Dorothy","\n              ","\n              ","\n                ","AS","\n                ","\n                  ","Author Supplied Abstract","\n                    [Word Indexed]","\n                  ","Performs a search for the value \"Y\"","\n                    indicating that the document contains","\n                    an author supplied abstract.","\n                ","\n                ","AS Y","\n              ","\n              ","\n                ","AU","\n                ","Author","\n                  [Word Indexed]\n                  ","Performs a keyword search for any authors of an article.","\n                ","\n                ","AU Rompalske","\n              ","\n              ","\n                ","CS","\n                ","Cover Story","\n                  [Phrase Indexed]\n                  ","Performs an exact search for the value Y or N.
