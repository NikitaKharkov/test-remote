Of those, 953 are not found with full text in any version of ","Academic Search™",", ","Health Source®"," or ","Nursing & Allied Health Collection™",". This authoritative file contains full text for many of the most used journals in the ","CINAHL®"," index, with no embargo. With full-text coverage dating back to 1937, ","CINAHL® Complete"," is the definitive research tool for all areas of nursing and allied health literature.","\n          ","CINAHL® Complete"," also provides indexing for more than 5,400 journals from the fields of nursing and allied health. The database contains more than 4.1 million records dating back to 1937. Offering complete coverage of English-language nursing journals and publications from the National League for Nursing and the American Nurses' Association, ","CINAHL® Complete"," covers nursing, biomedicine, health sciences librarianship, alternative/complementary medicine, consumer health and 17 allied health disciplines. In addition, this database offers access to health care books, nursing dissertations, selected conference proceedings, standards of practice, educational software, audiovisuals and book chapters. Searchable cited references for nearly 1,500 journals are also included.","\n          ","[back to top]","\n          ","\n          ","\n          ","There are a number of helpful tips and hints you can use to improve your search results. For example, you can use Boolean operators to link terms together; limit the search to a specific title; and /or restrict the search to a particular date range.","\n          ","Note: Stop-words are commonly used words such as articles, pronouns, and prepositions. These words are not indexed for searching in the database. For example, 'the,' 'for,' and 'of' are stop-words. When a stop-word is used in a query, any single word or no word is retrieved in place of the stop-word. When searching strings that contain stop-words or a Boolean operator, it is necessary to use quotation marks.","\n          ","\n          ","\n          ","Sometimes a search can be overly general (results equal too many hits) or overly specific (results equal too few hits). To fine tune your search, you can use AND, OR, and NOT operators to link your search words together. These operators will help you narrow or broaden your search to better express the terms you are looking for and to retrieve the exact information you need quickly.","\n          ","USING THE \"AND\" OPERATOR: If you have a search term that is too general, you can append several terms together using \"AND.\" By stringing key terms together, you can further define your search and reduce the number of results. Note: Unless you define a specific search field, the result list will contain references where all your search terms are located in either the citation, full display or full text.","\n          ","• For example, type ","high risk AND injury"," to find only articles that reference high risk injuries.","\n          ","USING THE \"OR\" OPERATOR: In order to broaden a search, you can link terms together by using the \"OR\" operator. By using \"OR\" to link your terms together you can find documents on many topics. Linked by this operator, your words are searched simultaneously and independently of each other.","\n          ","• As an example, search ","high risk AND injury OR trauma"," to find results that contain either the terms \"high risk\" and \"injury,\" or the term \"trauma.\"","\n          ","USING THE \"NOT\" OPERATOR: In order to narrow a search, you can link words together by using the \"NOT\" operator. This operator will help you to filter out specific topics you do not wish included as part of your search.","\n          ","\n            ","Type:"," high risk OR injury NOT trauma"," to find results that contain the terms \"high risk\" or \"injury,\" but not the term \"trauma.\"","\n            ","To further define your results, type:"," high risk AND injury AND trauma"," to constrict the search to include all terms linked by the \"AND\" operator.","\n          ","\n          ","\n          ","\n          ","Parentheses also may be used to control a search query. Without parentheses, a search is executed from left to right. Words that you enclose in parentheses are searched first. Why is this important? Parentheses allow you to control and define the way the search will be executed. The left phrase in parentheses is searched first; then based upon those results the second phrase in parentheses is searched.","\n          ","Generalized Search: heart or lung and blood or oxygen\nFocused Search: (heart or lung) and (blood or oxygen)\n","\n          ","In the first example, the search will retrieve everything on \"heart\" as well as references to the terms \"lung\" and \"blood,\" and everything on \"oxygen.\"","\n          ","In the second example, we have used the parentheses to control our query to only find articles about heart or lung that reference blood or oxygen.","\n          ","\n          ","\n          ","Using the entry date field (EM), you can narrow the search to a specific date. To search the most current articles of the database, the entry date field code is essential. For example,","\n          ","• Type: critical care and EM 201207","\n          ","In the example above, the entry month field will produce only results concerning critical care entered into the database in July 2012. Note: you can use a hyphen to indicate an open-ended date range. Entering a hyphen either before or after an entry month will find results \"on or before\" or \"on or after\" the date entered.","\n          ","\n            ","Example: type nursing home and EM 201207- (to retrieve articles about nursing homes entered from July 2012 to the present).","\n            ","Example: type twins and EM -201207 (to retrieve articles about twins entered previous to and including July 2012).","\n          ","\n          ","[back to top]","\n          ","\n          ","\n          ","The default fields for unqualified searches consist of the following: Title, Abstract and Subject headings.","\n          ","The following list will help you locate detailed information using field tags.","\n          ","\n            ","\n              ","\n                ","Searchable Tag","\n                ","Description","\n                ","Example","\n              ","\n              ","\n                ","AA","\n                ","Abstract Available","\n                  [Phrase Indexed]\n                  ","Performs an exact search for the value Y or N.

The headings can be exploded to retrieve all references indexed to that term as well as all references indexed to any narrower term(s).
