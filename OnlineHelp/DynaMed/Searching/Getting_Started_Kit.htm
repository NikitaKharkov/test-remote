  <h1>DynaMed Getting Started Kit</h1>
  <p>Thank you for purchasing DynaMed. Below you will find step-by-step directions along with materials and recommendations to help you implement and promote your new clinical decision support tool.</p>
  <h3>Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with DynaMed</h3>
  <p>As the point person for your organization’s implementation of DynaMed, it’s important for you to feel comfortable using it. Knowing what DynaMed is, how to use it, and becoming familiar with its features and functionality will help you be a strong resource for the clinical users you support.</p>
  <p>We recommend doing the following to help familiarize yourself with DynaMed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Watch this brief <a href="https://connect.ebsco.com/s/article/DynaMed-Tutorial" target="_blank">DynaMed overview tutorial</a>.</li>
    <li>Log in to DynaMed and explore to get a feel for what your users will experience.
      <ul>
        <li>Do a search and look at how the results are organized</li>
        <li>Open a topic and look at the sections, subsections, images, and links to primary evidence</li>
        <li>Look at the drug and lab topics to see how Micromedex content is included in DynaMed</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Take one of our <a href="https://ebscotraining.webex.com/mw3300/mywebex/default.do?siteurl=ebscotraining" target="_blank" title="live training courses">live training courses</a> or <a href="https://ebscotraining.webex.com/tc3300/trainingcenter/record/navRecordAction.do?siteurl=ebscotraining" target="_blank" title="recorded training sessions on DynaMed">recorded training sessions</a> on DynaMed.</li>
    <li>Reach out to recruit a few clinical champions who can assist in the rollout and act as a secondary contact when clinicians have questions.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Step 2: Set Up Access</h3>
  <p>Next, focus on making sure DynaMed is easily accessible in all your users’ clinical workflows. The more access points the better, as this ensures that no matter when a clinical question arises, your users will be able to get to DynaMed and an evidence-based answer quickly and easily.</p>
  <p>We suggest taking the access link/URL provided to you via email by your EBSCO Health representative and adding it to the following places. You may need to reach out to your institution’s IT and/or EMR administrator to have these changes made.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In the toolbar of your EMR as an Infobutton (If Applicable)
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://connect.ebsco.com/s/article/Set-Up-Information-for-EMR-HL7-Infobutton-Integrations" target="_blank">Click here to learn how</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>On your intranet alongside any other medical information resources</li>
    <li>As a desktop icon on all clinical workstations
      <ul>
        <li>To get an attention-grabbing image, check out our library of <a href="https://www.ebsco.com/promotional-materials?search=dynamed" target="_blank" title="DynaMed Logos, Buttons">DynaMed Logos, Buttons &amp; Icons</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>On your organization’s medical library site (If Applicable)</li>
    <li>On your physician portal (If Applicable)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Step 3: Create a Communication Plan</h3>
  <p>Now that you are comfortable with DynaMed and have set up access points for users, it’s time to create a communication plan. The communication plan will depend on your organization’s workflows and culture, but the goal is to ensure that all users know that DynaMed is available, how to access it, and why they should use it.</p>
  <p>Here are some examples of effective ways to communicate to your users that DynaMed is now available to them:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Send an email blast to all clinical staff
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.ebsco.com/sites/g/files/nabnos191/files/acquiadam-assets/DynaMed-August-2019-Transition-Email-Template.docx" target="_blank" title="DynaMed Transition Email Blast Template">DynaMed Transition Email Blast Template</a>
          <ul>
            <li>You may want to coordinate this communication with your institution’s clinical leadership teams, including the CMO, CNO, CMIO, heads of staff, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Make the announcement as part of the next medical staff or department head meeting</li>
    <li>Organize a group of clinical champions to help you spread the word at shift change meets, rounds or staff huddles</li>
    <li>Make DynaMed a part of your new hire orientation</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Step 4: Educate Your Users</h3>
  <p>Training and educating your users is essential for successful adoption, ensuring good usage and user satisfaction. End-user training can take many forms, including formal classroom style demos, quick in-service sessions facilitated by you or a clinical educator, handouts, and videos.</p>
  <p>EBSCO Health offers a wide variety of tools to help educate your users about DynaMed, all which can be shared with users via the communication method above.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://connect.ebsco.com/s/article/DynaMed-Tutorial" target="_blank">DynaMed Tutorial</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://ebscotraining.webex.com/mw3300/mywebex/default.do?siteurl=ebscotraining" target="_blank" title="DynaMed Live Trainings">DynaMed Live Trainings</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://ebscotraining.webex.com/tc3300/trainingcenter/record/navRecordAction.do?siteurl=ebscotraining" target="_blank" title="DynaMed Recorded Trainings">DynaMed Recorded Trainings</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>We also encourage you and your clinical champions to demo DynaMed at medical staff meetings, department head meetings, shift change meetings and staff huddles.</p>
  <h3>Step 5: Promote DynaMed</h3>
  <p>Last but not least, be sure to continuously promote DynaMed to your clinicians. We have a selection of easy to use and engaging promotional materials you can download and share as you continue to rollout DynaMed.</p>
  <p>Display the following collateral in your break rooms and staff lounges as a reminder that DynaMed is available.</p>
