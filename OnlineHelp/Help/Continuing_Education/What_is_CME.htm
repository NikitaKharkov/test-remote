  <h3><b>What is DynaMed CE?</b></h3>
  <p>Physicians and nurse practitioners using DynaMed to inform and support their clinical decisions are eligible to earn continuing medical education (CME) credits and continuing nursing education (CNE) contact hours, respectively, for this internet point of care (PoC) activity. Physicians in certain specialties may also be eligible to earn Part II Maintenance of Certification (MOC) points (See Accreditation/Credit Designation). The American Medical Association (AMA) Physician&#39;s Recognition Award and credit system describes internet point of care (PoC) CME as self-directed, online learning on topics relevant to a physician’s clinical practice from a database whose content has been vetted by an accredited CME provider.</p>
  <p>Learning for this activity is based on a reflective process in which a learner 1) identifies a problem in practice, 2) accesses content in search of an answer from DynaMed content, and 3) documents the clinical question and the application to practice. Physicians conducting structured online searching and learning may claim 0.5 <i>AMA PRA Category 1 Credit</i>™ for the documented completion of the three-step learning cycle. A maximum of 20 <i>AMA PRA Category 1 Credits</i>™ may be claimed per year for this activity.</p>

  <h3><b>Method of Participation</b></h3>
  <p><b>How to earn CME/CE/CPD Credit/Contact Hours</b></p>
  <p>After finishing a qualified search, you may complete the additional required steps to earn CME/CE/CPD for that activity (0.5 credit/contact hour per search).</p>
  <p>When you first navigate to the CME/CE/CPD workflow you will need to make sure that you have your settings current to be able to claim your CME/CE/CPD credit. If you click on the settings gear in the top right of the interface, you will launch the settings screen. From this screen you will fill in your personal information and select a degree from the list. The degree determines whether you will receive a Credit Certificate, Certificate of Completion, AANP Certificate. If you select the Certificate of Attendance checkbox below the form, this setting will override the above Certificates and the system will generate a generic Certificate of Attendance that can be used to submit Contact Hours rather than Credits.</p>
  <p>These steps include answering questions in order to document 1) the condition or clinical issue (what you needed to find), 2) the contents located (what you found), and 3) the result of the search (application to practice). Follow the instructions for each question.</p>
  <p><b>How to claim CME/CE/CPD Credit/Contact Hours</b></p>
  <p>To claim CME/CE/CPD credits you will need to prepare the submission by answering question in order to document 1) the condition or clinical issue (what you needed to find), 2) the contents located (what you found), and 3) the result of the search (application to practice). Click Prepare and follow the instructions for each question.</p>
  <p>Once you have completed the questions you will see that the prepared credit is ready to claim and generate the certificate. By clicking on the blue Claim Credit button. You will then be taken to the claimed credits tab and the certificate generated will be the first one in the list. Your claimed credits are organized by year.</p>
  <p><b>How to submit Maintenance of Certification (MOC)</b></p>
  <p>DynaMed has simplified the process of submitting your MOC to the appropriate board and will automatically submit to all boards you have configured in your settings. User can navigate to the settings gear and open the settings pane. You will see that you can select a board from the dropdown and enter your board ID. A user can add one or more board in which they are certified. Once the MOC settings have been configured and saved the DynaMed system will automatically submit the CME credit for MOC.</p>
  <p>Please note that MOC is only available for United States certified physicians and only CME credits are able to be submitted.</p>
  <p><b>How to view submissions for Maintenance of Certification (MOC)</b></p>
  <p>Within the DynaMed CME/MOC workflow you will see a tab labeled MOC. By navigating to that tab the user can see the different boards that they have configured. Under each board you will see the submissions grouped by year and each individual CME credit that has been submitted for MOC to the appropriate board. For a physician to view the status of the DynaMed MOC submissions the user will need to click the available link to the board and use your board specific credentials to gain access and view the current status of the submission.</p>
