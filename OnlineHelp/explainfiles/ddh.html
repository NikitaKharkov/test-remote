The database is updated weekly on   EBSCO<em>host</em>.</p>   <p><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>  <hr />  <a name="B" title="B"></a>   <h3 style="color: #003399; text-align: center">Searching Tips</h3>  <p class="medium-normal">Following&nbsp;are a number of helpful tips and hints you can use to improve your search results. For example, you can use Boolean operators to   link search terms together; and/or limit the search to a specific title.</p>   <h3 style="color: #003399; text-align: center">Boolean Operators</h3>   <p>Sometimes a search can be overly general (results equal too many hits) or overly specific (results equal too few hits). To fine tune your search, you can use AND, OR, and   NOT operators to link your search words together. These operators will help you narrow or broaden your search to better express the terms you are looking for and to retrieve the   exact information you need quickly.</p>  <p>USING THE &quot;AND&quot; OPERATOR: If you have a search term that is too general, you can append several terms together using &quot;AND&quot;. By stringing key   terms together, you can further define your search and reduce the number of results. Note: Unless you define a specific search field, the result list will contain references where all   your search terms are located in either the citation, full display or full text.</p>  <ul>  <li>For example, type <strong>gingivitis AND plaque</strong> to find results that refer to both gingivitis and plaque. </li></ul>  <p>USING THE &quot;OR&quot; OPERATOR: In order to broaden a search, you can link terms together by using the &quot;OR&quot; operator. By using &quot;OR&quot; to link   your terms together you can find documents on many topics. Linked by this operator, your words are searched simultaneously and independently of each other.</p>  <ul>  <li>As an example, search <strong>gingivitis AND chlorhexidine OR plaque</strong> to find results that reference the terms &quot;gingivitis&quot; and &quot;chlorhexidine&quot;, or the term   &quot;plaque&quot;.</li></ul>  <p>USING THE &quot;NOT&quot; OPERATOR: In order to narrow a search, you can link words together by using the &quot;NOT&quot; operator. This operator will help you to   filter out specific topics you do not wish included as part of your search.</p>  <ul>  <li>Type: <strong>gingivitis OR chlorhexidine NOT plaque</strong> to find results that contain the terms &quot;gingivitis&quot; or &quot;chlorhexidine&quot; but not the term &quot;plaque&quot;.  </li>  <li>To further define your results, type: <strong>gingivitis AND chlorhexidine AND plaque</strong> to constrict the search to include all terms linked by the &quot;AND&quot; operator.  </li>  </ul>      <h3 style="color: #003399; text-align: center">Grouping Terms Together Using Parentheses</h3>   <p>Parentheses also may be used to control a search query. Without parentheses, a search is executed from left to right. Words that you enclose in parentheses are searched   first. Why is this important? Parentheses allow you to control and define the way the search will be executed. The left phrase in parentheses is searched first; then based upon   those results the second phrase in parentheses is searched.</p>  <ul>  <li><strong>Generalized Search:</strong><br />gingivitis OR plaque AND care OR hygiene</li> <li><strong>Focused Search:</strong><br />(gingivitis OR plaque) AND (care OR hygiene)</li></ul>   <p>In the first example, the search will retrieve everything on gingivitis or plaque care AS WELL AS everything on hygiene whether or not the articles refer to gingivitis or   plaque.</p>  <p>In the second example, we have used the parentheses to control our query to only find articles about care or hygiene that reference gingivitis or plaque.</p>  <p><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>  <hr />  <a name="C" title="C"></a>  <h3 style="color: #003399; text-align: center"><a name="C" title="C"></a>Searchable Fields</h3>   <p>The default fields for unqualified searches consist of the following: all authors, all subjects, all keywords, all title info (including source title) and all abstracts.</p>  <p>The following list will help you locate detailed information referenced in this database as a field.</p>   <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1"><tbody> <tr><th>Searchable tag</th><th>Description </th><th>Example</th></tr>  <tr><td>AB</td><td>Abstract or Author-Supplied Abstract<br />[Word Indexed] <p>Performs a keyword search of the abstract summaries.</p></td><td>AB cosmetic surgery</td></tr>  <tr><td>AD</td><td>Author Affiliation<br />[Phrase Indexed] <p>Performs an exact search for companies or organizations an author is affiliated with; may also include   correspondence address.</p></td><td>AD Department of Periodontology, School of Dentistry, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway</td></tr>  <tr><td>AF</td><td>Author Affiliation<br />[Word Indexed] <p>Performs a keyword search for companies or organizations an author is affiliated with; may also include   correspondence address.</p></td><td>AF The University of Texas</td></tr>  <tr><td>AN</td><td>Accession Number<br />[Phrase Indexed] <p>Performs an exact search for an article&#39;s identification (accession) number.</p></td><td>AN 21701071</td></tr>  <tr><td>AR</td><td>Author<br />[Phrase Indexed] <p>Performs an exact search for an article&#39;s author in the inverted format, and the uninverted format for newswire   articles.</p></td><td>AR Smith, C.
