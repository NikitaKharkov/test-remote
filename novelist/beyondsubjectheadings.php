  		<p><br />
			NoveList took the art of suggesting books beyond subject headings, by adding appeal terms such as tone, writing style, and pace to our records. We've added appeal terms that relate more to the reader's experience than subject headings alone can. NoveList has teamed with influential Readers' Advisory experts and librarians to develop a "vocabulary of appeal" to help readers - and the librarians serving them - find books that have the "style" that they prefer.  NoveList's addition of appeal terms significantly enhances searches and recommendations for authors, titles, and series.<br><br>
