<p>Physicians and nurse practitioners using DynaMed to inform and support their clinical decisions may now earn Continuing Medical Education (CME) credits and Continuing Nursing Education (CNE) Contact Hours, respectively, for this activity. As stated in the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician's Recognition Award and credit system, "Internet point of care (PoC) CME describes structured, self-directed, online learning by physicians on topics relevant to their clinical practice. Learning for this activity is driven by a reflective process in which physicians must document their clinical question, the sources consulted and the application to practice.</p>
<p>Physicians conducting structured online searches on clinical topics may claim a half (0.5) AMA PRA Category 1 Credit<sup style="font-size: 8px;">TM</sup> for documented completion (either at the point of care or later) of the three-step learning cycle." In addition, this activity has been reviewed and is acceptable for up to 20 Prescribed credits by the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and is also approved for up to 20 contact hours of continuing education by the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners (AANP).</p>
