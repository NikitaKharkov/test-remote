/*
Sometimes in Safari divs with a specified height and overflow:auto take up more 
space "interactively" than they do visually. In other words they have a 
scrollbar and their height is constrained visually, but you can't click elements 
directly below them since Safari ignores the presence of scrollbars in terms of 
clickable area. Instead  idcalculating clickable area as though height:auto had 
been set and the div had extended to its complete height. 
I'm fixing this bug by giving all elements in the form a z-index of 2, then 
giving the offending divs a z-index of 1. This causes the other elements to be 
"above" the offending divs so the user can click them despite the Safari bug.

form>* { position: relative; z-index: 2 }
#sections { z-index: 1 }
