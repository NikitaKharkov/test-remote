<h2><a name="what">What is DynaMed CE?</a></h2>
<h3>Physicians and nurse practitioners using DynaMed to inform and support their clinical decisions may now earn Continuing Medical Education (CME) credits and Continuing Nursing Education (CNE) Contact Hours, respectively, for this activity. As stated in the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician's Recognition Award and credit system, "Internet point of care (PoC) CME describes structured, self-directed, online learning by physicians on topics relevant to their clinical practice. Learning for this activity is driven by a reflective process in which physicians must document their clinical question, the sources consulted and the application to practice. Physicians conducting structured online searches on clinical topics may claim a half (0.5) <i>AMA PRA Category 1 Credit</i>&trade; for documented completion (either at the point of care or later) of the three-step learning cycle." For physicians claiming Internet point of care CME, there is a limit of twenty (20) 
<i>AMA PRA Category 1 Credits</i>&trade; per year.</h3>

These steps include answering questions in order to document 1) the condition or clinical issue (what you needed to find), 2) the contents located (what you found), and 3) the result of the search (what you learned). Follow the instructions for each question.</h3>
<h3>You then enter your name and email address, and select the type of credit. Once the information is submitted, you will receive an email with instructions for claiming DynaMed credits on the Tufts Online Credit Tracker.</h3>

<ul style="padding-left:4em; list-style:square">
<li>Go to <a target="_blank" href="http://cme.thci.org">http://cme.thci.org</a></li>
<li>First-time users will need to request their password for the Credit Tracker (note: this is a different password than the user's DynaMed password). Click on "Forgot password" and enter the same email address entered on the DynaMed screen. Once in the site, users may change their password by selecting My Account/Profile.</li>
<li>For subsequent logins, use the password of record.</li>
<li>Once logged in, users will see CE Certificates already granted. A second screen provides a list of searches that earned 0.5 credits. Users may select some or all of these searches for a new Certificate, up to a maximum of 40 searches (20 credits) for a single Certificate.</li>
<li>Users are required to complete a brief evaluation of the Internet point of care CE learning format prior to receiving the first Certificate.</li>
<li><u>Credits must be claimed within six months of the search date</u>. Searches and credits that remain unclaimed are deleted after six months.</li>
<li>Certificates will remain online in the Credit Tracker for a six-year period.</li>
