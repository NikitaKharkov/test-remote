<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Holdings Upload Matching - Internal Information</strong></p><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><br />What is the Resolve Ambiguous Matches Feature?</strong><br />When a holdings file is uploaded without identifiers (KBIDs), the system automatically matches uploaded titles to items in the EBSCO knowledge base using Title Name, Package, URL etc.&#160; Sometimes more than one potential match is identified and the system doesn&#8217;t know which one to select.&#160; With the Resolve Ambiguous Matches feature, you can review the potential matches and manually select the correct one.</p><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Ambiguous matches can also result from the <a href="http://support.ebsco.com/help/?int=eadhlm&#38;ver=live&#38;lang=en&#38;feature_id=Scrubber" target="_blank">Match Custom Titles to EBSCO&#39;s Global Knowledge Base</a>  feature.&#160; You can use Resolve Ambiguous Matches to select the best match for these titles, as well. </p><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /><strong>When Can I Resolve Ambiguous Matches?</strong><br />When the most recent Holdings Upload or <a href="http://support.ebsco.com/help/?int=eadhlm&#38;ver=live&#38;lang=en&#38;feature_id=Scrubber" target="_blank">Custom Matching</a>  contains at least one ambiguously matched title, the Resolve Ambiguous Matches link will appear on the Overview.&#160; Click the link to access the ambiguously matched titles and select your matches.&#160; You can work through your items until you are finished or until another Holdings Upload or Custom Matching is processed with at least one ambiguously matched title.&#160; If this happens, your matching session will be &#8220;closed&#8221; meaning no additional matching on that load is possible.&#160; But don&#8217;t worry, all the matching you have done prior to the load being closed has been applied.</p><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /><strong>How is Matching Applied?</strong><br />As soon as you select a match for your title, the match is applied.&#160; There is no ability to undo your match at this time.</p><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /><strong>Are My Match Selections Remembered?</strong><br />The system doesn&#8217;t support matching memory at this time.&#160; This means that if you upload a file without IDs, match the ambiguously matched items and then re-upload a similar file (again without IDs), you will need to re-select the appropriate matches.</p><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /><strong>If I Complete All the Matching, is the Entire Upload Matched?</strong><br />Maybe not.&#160; The Resolve Ambiguous Matches feature currently only allows the selection of matches for items where the system has identified multiple potential matches.&#160; There may be other items in your upload for which the system was unable to find any match at all.&#160; Those items cannot be matched using this feature at this time.</p><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /><strong>How Does this Feature Related to the Error File?</strong><br />This feature allows you to manually select matches for all items in your error file that have an error of &#8220;Duplicate Title Match&#8221;.&#160; </p><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /><strong>Who Can Use this Feature?</strong><br />In order to use this feature, you must have rights to the Holdings Matching role in Gold Admin.&#160; So this is an EBSCO internal only feature at this time.&#160; We plan to open this feature up to customers after the second release.</p><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /><strong>Known Issues</strong><br />There are some known issues with the product.&#160; You can find them listed here: <a href="http://confluence/display/SPM/Matching+UI+Phase+1+Known+Issues">http://confluence/display/SPM/Matching+UI+Phase+1+Known+Issues</a> </p><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /><strong>What if I Have Feedback?</strong><br />We are looking forward to hearing what you think of this feature.&#160; If you have feedback, whether defects or enhancement requests, please file them as SIs via NetCRM.&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Matching algorithms can&#8217;t match every title, however.&#160; Some titles are unmatched because we can&#8217;t match the Package or because we don&#8217;t have a similar title in our knowledge base.&#160; Other titles can&#8217;t be automatically matched because we find multiple potential matches.<br /></span></span></p>
